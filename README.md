# Student-Performance-Analysis-Using-Multiple-Linear-Regression

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between student attendance, exercise scores, and overall performance using multiple linear regression. By analyzing real classroom data from 145 students, we aimed to determine how well these factors predict final grades and uncover actionable insights for educators.

ðŸ”¬ Methodology
	1. Data Collection: Student records including attendance percentages, weekly exercise scores, and final exam scores.
	2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values and ensured data consistency using Google Sheets.
	3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized relationships between variables to understand correlations.
	4. Regression Modeling: Used Python (Google Colab) to perform multiple linear regression and assess the predictive power of attendance and exercise scores.

ðŸ“Š Key Findings
	1. Attendance alone is a weak predictor of performance (RÂ² = 0.198, correlation r = 0.44).
	2. Exercise scores are a much stronger predictor (RÂ² = 0.535, correlation r = 0.83).
	3. For every 1-point increase in exercise scores, final grades improve by approximately 2.2 points.
	4. Other factors likely influence performance, as 46.5% of the variation remains unexplained.

ðŸ“Œ Recommendations
	1. Prioritize student engagement over attendance aloneâ€”active participation in exercises has a greater impact on performance.
	2. Use analytics to identify struggling students early, based on exercise scores rather than just attendance.
	3. Enhance the model with additional features like homework scores, quiz results, and study habits for better predictions.

ðŸš€ Tools & Technologies Used
	1. Google Sheets for data organization
	2. Python (Google Colab, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn) for regression modeling
	3. Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

This project highlights the power of data-driven decision-making in education and demonstrates how predictive analytics can help improve student outcomes.
